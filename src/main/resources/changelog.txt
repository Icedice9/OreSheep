v4.0.0
	Update to 1.12.2. Yay!
	New possible block options for ore sheep (portals, sugarcane etc).
	Now Linux compatible!
	Drawing texures for ore sheep is much faster.
	Added config and server command to enable "ignore mob griefing game rule." Command is /ignoreGameRuleMobGriefing (true/false)
	Server to client communication is better (no more despawns or sheep ore changes on server unload).
	An incorrect tool used on sheep makes breaking sound (ex: pickaxe on wood ore sheep makes break sound)
	Shears no longer break when used on ore sheep.
	Sheep converted to ore sheep now keep potion effects and name tags.
	Remember "jeb_"? Try "Icedice9"
	Log file is more descriptive.
	Removed debug mode.
v3.1.0
	Rewrote the system for determining how many sub-blocks a block has. Essentially, this means the mod is faster, more accurate, less resource intensive, and less crashy!
	There is no longer a lag when looking at an ore sheep for the first time because textures are now drawn when needed, rather than all at once.
	Revealed debug mode. Add the entry "true" to the top of the OreConfig.txt. Then while in creative mode, right click an ore sheep with:
		a stick or blaze rod to move through the block array. 
		an apple to print an its block info. 
		a bone to load all ore sheep textures again (warning- this may take several seconds!)
	The mod now detects all ores from the forestry, biomesoplenty, and artifice mods.
	Fixed some blocks not being sheared by the correct tool. (Blocks with "mud" in their names)
	Ore Sheep can no longer grow double slabs.
v3.0.3
	Fixed some blocks not being sheared by the correct tool. (Blocks with "sand" or "log" in their names)
	Added more useful info to the log file.
	TConstruct landmines are now consumed when eaten.
v3.0.2
	Fixed a crash with the Artifice Mod.
	Removed extra log block metadata from array.
	The log text file now gives more information on bugs (easier for me to fix!)
v3.0.1
	Fixed a crash with the Jabba mod (better barrels by Mobius). Sheep do not eat barrels!
v3.0.0
	Added the "OreConfig" text file, a configuration file that allows sheep to eat blocks the player specifies.  It can be edited while the client is running, when not in a world.  Servers must be restarted for change to take effect.
	Sheep can now eat other mod ores and blocks.
	Added the "PossibleBlocks" text file that shows the player what blocks the sheep can be.
	Added the "Log" text file.  If the game crashes, or bugs occur, send this file to the oresheepmod author.
	Sheep must now be sheared with the appropriate tool. You can't shear diamond with a wood pickaxe, dirt related blocks must be sheared with a shovel, wood with an axe, and wool with shears.
	If in creative mode, the player can use bonemeal on a fully grown sheep to grow back its ore.  If the sheep is a baby, the bonemeal increases its age.
	Ore sheep now have block dependent sheared textures.
	Sheared sheep ore can be changed in creative, just like non-sheared sheep.
	When sheared, sheep make the break sound for the their block instead of the stone breaking sound.
	Added Spanish language files.
	Netherrack sheep can now be obtained in survival mode and acts as a regular ore sheep ore by default.
v2.6
	Fixed a serious server side crash.
v2.5
	Added the netherrack ore sheep.
	Most other mod pickaxes now shear sheep as well.
	Sheared ore sheep now have ore splotches instead of wool ones.
	Ore sheep now use resource pack ore textures for their own textures.  This means that ore sheep will take the appearance of the ores in installed resource packs.
v2.4
	Converting a sheep no longer removes its name tag. 
v2.3
	Due to popular demand, ore is again genetically inherited.
	You can now change baby ore type while in creative, just like adults, by right clicking on one with the ore you want.
	Shears are now damaged when you try to use them on an ore sheep. Ore sheep are rock solid after all!
	Wool ore sheep can be sheared with shears and drop 1-3 wool.  But how would you get a wool ore sheep anyway?
	Minor bug fixes and improvements.
v2.2
	Breeding two ore sheep now spawns a regular baby sheep.  Ore is no longer genetically inherited :)
v2.1
	Removed ore sheep "ghost" client entities.
v2.0
	Ore sheep are now bred with many different stone blocks and ores instead of wheat.
	Ore sheep now also eat netherrack, stone slabs, cobblestone and stone brick stairs, stone bricks, stone buttons, stone pressure plates, mossy cobblestone, and cobblestone walls.
v1.0:
	Added ore sheep!
